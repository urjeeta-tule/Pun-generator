curiosity kills the cat
long time no see
better late than sorry
time and tide wait for no man
ball is in your court
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
a penny for your thoughts
once in a blue moon
taste of your own medicine
drive someone up the wall
riding shotgun
kick the bucket
saved by the bell
last but not the least
wouldn't be caught dead
over my dead body
icing on the cake
cherry on top
from rags to riches
standing on your own feet
